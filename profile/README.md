# Username Change
I have decided to change my GitHub username from `WilliamDavidHarrison` to `wdhdev` as it is significantly shorter *and* it was the username of my existing GitHub organisation which had quite a few of my projects already.

I moved all my projects on my GitHub organisation to my personal account as the new username of my personal account was the original name of the organisation, so most of my existing projects were still accessible at the same URL.

I then renamed the GitHub organsiation to `WilliamDavidHarrison` (this organisation) so my old username was still owned and managed by me, except as a GitHub organisation. I did this just to prevent any possible impersonation attempts and also so existing comments on issues and pull requests mentioning my old username would reference this organisation, so if people were looking at old comments they could still find my account.
